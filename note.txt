Events from signal

parameters:
    # currently not needed for the algorithm, but probably will be useful for the final product
    max_allowed_signal
    wave_amplitude_allowance # might end up in the algorithm
    pre_gain
    post_gain

algorithm:
    # Basic idea is that we are outputting the peak of every wave.
    # Once the signal dips from the peak, we know that the last highest
    # point in the signal was the peak.
    # We also know that if we hold on to the last peak, we will miss
    # the other peaks.
    current_peak = negative_infinity
    for each signal_value in wave:
        if signal_value > current_peak:
            current_peak = signal_value
        elif current_peak != negative_infinity:
            output(current_peak)
            current_peak = negative_infinity

    # probably need some data from the wave (or outer parameter to tweak) so that
    # the scaling to midi will work. Currently it is a wave of unknown amplitude,
    # so I'm puzzled as to how to convert that to a number between 1 and 127 (midi velocity).
